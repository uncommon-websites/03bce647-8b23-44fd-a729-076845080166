    "description": "The image shows a mostly white screen with minimal text. The main text on the left side of the screen says \"What's your Linkedin?\" in a black bold font, with \"Linkedin\" particularly emphasized in bold. Below this text, there is very faint grey text that reads \"Invest in my company.\" \n\nOn the right side of the screen, there is a grey circular button with a right-facing arrow inside it. At the bottom-left corner, there is a part of an interface visible including the word \"Website\" and a small green indicator labeled \"v10,\" with a dropdown arrow next to \"Website.\"  \n\nThe overall look is very clean and minimalistic, likely part of a form or an app interface focusing on collecting or asking for LinkedIn information."
